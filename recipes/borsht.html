  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Borscht is a hearty and flavorful soup characterized by its deep crimson hue and robust taste. It is often served hot, though it can also be enjoyed cold, especially during the summer months. The soup has a rich and slightly sweet flavor with a tangy undertone, owing to ingredients like vinegar or lemon juice commonly used in its preparation.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Beets: These root vegetables are the star ingredient of borscht, giving the soup its distinctive color and earthy flavor.</li>
    <li>Broth: Typically, borscht is made with a beef or vegetable broth base, providing a savory foundation for the soup.</li>
    <li>Cabbage: Finely shredded cabbage adds texture and a slightly sweet flavor to the soup.</li>
    <li>Potatoes: Cubed or sliced potatoes are often added to borscht to make it more hearty and filling.</li>
    <li>Carrots: Diced or grated carrots contribute sweetness and color to the soup.</li>
    <li>Onions: Sautéed onions provide depth of flavor to the broth.</li>
    <li>Garlic: Minced garlic adds aromatic richness to the soup.</li>
    <li>Tomato paste or tomatoes: Tomato paste or fresh tomatoes are commonly used to enhance the flavor and add acidity to the soup.</li>
    <li>Vinegar or lemon juice: A small amount of vinegar or lemon juice is added to borscht to balance the sweetness of the beets and provide a subtle tanginess.</li>
    <li>Herbs and spices: Commonly used herbs and spices include bay leaves, dill, parsley, and sometimes paprika or black pepper, imparting additional layers of flavor.</li>
    <li>Sour cream (optional): A dollop of sour cream is often served on top of each bowl of borscht, adding creaminess and a tangy contrast to the soup.</li>
