  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide flat pasta sheets, typically layered with rich and savory ingredients such as tomato sauce, ground meat (commonly beef or pork), vegetables like onions, garlic, and sometimes mushrooms, and a creamy cheese sauce, usually ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The dish is typically assembled in a rectangular baking dish and baked until the pasta is tender and the cheese on top is melted and golden brown. Lasagna is known for its comforting and hearty flavors, making it a popular choice for family gatherings and special occasions. It can be customized with various ingredients and variations, but the essence of lasagna lies in its layered construction and melding of flavors.</p>
